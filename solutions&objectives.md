**Formulate a set of solution goals, objectives, or value propositions**

**To craft an effective outcome-based value proposition:**

- Identify your target audience's biggest challenge.
- Determine the end result they want to achieve.
- Figure out how your product or service enables them to achieve that outcome.
- Combine these elements into a concise statement following this formula:

A set of solution goals is a collection of specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound (SMART) objectives that are designed to address and resolve a particular problem.

**Define the problem**

The actual Problem is that the loyalty program is outdated, with physical cards and paper statements. This is not allowing Bright Star to get new customers; in fact, they lose customers to competitors, also reducing loyalty, outdated promo offers and operational inefficiency. In-store customers are frustrated with the returns and exchange process.

**Setting Smart Goals**

1\. 30% loyalty increase in digital sign-ups over a period of 12 months.

2\. 30% downloads of the app over a period of 12 months compared to the previous year. (“I want to see more users downloading the app and actively buying through it”, Marketing Managing Director)

3\. 30 % reduction in transaction time over a period of 12 months.

4\. 15% increase in web traffic over a period of 12 months

5\. Improve customer retention and user experience for Gen Z and millennials in-store and online over a period of 12 months.

6\. Implement a personalized birthday campaign offering 5% discounts to improve customer engagement and increase repeat purchases tracked over 6 months.

7\. Reduce return rate by 10% over the next 6 months by improving product descriptions and visuals, ensuring customer clarity.

(“After a marketing or sales campaign, we always have a spike in returns of the product. The volume is sometimes unmanageable and costly”, Operations Manager)

**Value Propositions**

For millennials who want their best digital experience, our loyalty program is promising personalised experiences.

Helping Gen Z achieve their digital dream shopping experience through our Loyalty program.

**Define the business problem.**

Seamless digital experience and personalized experiences for Millennials and Gen Z in store and online.

- Main challenges: outdated manual loyalty registration system, customer drop off, lack of staff training.

“Sometimes, my points don’t appear immediately after a purchase, so I have to call the helpline, but even then, I am always waiting or on hold. Now I shop at Sainsbury’s because everything works.”

“I always forget my physical card. I wish it were on my phone like everything else.”, “I earned enough points for a reward, but when I tried to redeem it, the cashier didn’t know how, and I had to go to the customer service desk. Too much hassle\!”

**Agent empowerment:** Agent empowerment means giving your employees the freedom to act as they see fit with regard to customer issue resolution.

**Backlog:** Your backlog refers to the number of tickets that are unresolved in your customer support queue. It’s important to try to keep this number as low as possible, or it could lead to dissatisfied and unhappy customers.

**Benchmarking:** Benchmarking is the process of measuring your company’s (or an individual’s) performance against an aspirational standard. This standard could be set by your competitors or the industry as a whole.

**Business hours:** Your business hours are the time of day your company is available to answer customer support requests.

**Customer Effort Score (CES):** is a [metric](https://www.keeping.com/content/customer-service-metrics/) that measures the amount of effort it takes for customers to complete an interaction with your business. It’s calculated using a survey sent out to your customers after a particular experience with your support team.

**Customer:** A stakeholder who uses or may use products or services produced by the enterprise and may have contractual or moral rights that the enterprise is obliged to meet.

**Customer effort**: The amount of work your **customer** has to do themselves to resolve an issue. Generally, best kept at a low as possible level.

Empathy is perhaps the most important skill that customer service agents need to cultivate, especially when dealing with [rude and angry customers](https://www.keeping.com/content/how-to-deal-with-rude-customers/).

**Feedback:** Feedback is the thoughts and opinions of customers with regard to your company, including areas that could be improved. Feedback might be solicited through surveys, or it might be unsolicited reviews or social media comments.

**Helpline**: a telephone service providing help with problems.

**Personalisation:** Personalisation is when a business’s communications are tailored towards the needs of an individual customer. It might be something as simple as using a customer’s name in a support interaction, or sending them personalised email campaigns that recommend products and services.
