Bright Star Department Stores is a major retail chain selling food and products in stores and online. Bright Star aims to become a digitally-driven retailer that offers seamless, personalized, and efficient experiences across all customer touchpoints.

**Problem Statement**

Bright Star is currently having significant customer complaints with its “Star Rewards” loyalty program. In recent customer feedback, customers have expressed that the loyalty program is outdated. Customers report several issues:

- The program uses physical cards and old post statements that are easy to lose.
- The offers are not relevant to their needs.
- Sign-up takes a long time at the service desk, which causes frustration.
- Experience is better with other competitors like Sainsbury's.
- Customers are leaving for competitors that offer a smoother and faster digital experience.

Experience in the store has some challenges:

- Long lines at the customer service desk for returns.
- Staff apply the wrong return rules.
- Refunds need several days to be updated, and there is no easy way of tracking it.
- Manual data entry is causing errors.
